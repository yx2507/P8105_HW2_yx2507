# Problem 1

## 1.1 Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

  - specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read\_excel
  - use reasonable variable names
  - omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  - round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts
    the result to an integer variable (using
as.integer)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
trash_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(dumpster != "NA") %>%
mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))

## check
view(trash_data)
```

## 1.2 Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For each, omit rows without precipitation data and add a variable year. Next, combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
data_rain_2018 = 
    read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = '2018 Precipitation', range = "A2:B15") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    filter(total != "NA") %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018)

data_rain_2017=
  read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = '2017 Precipitation', range = "A2:B15") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    filter(total != "NA") %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017)
```

## combine and get a`month.name` variable

``` r
data_raintot = bind_rows(data_rain_2017, data_rain_2018) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
    select(year, month, total)
```

In trash\_data, there are 285 rows and 15columns with variables related
to trash like plastic bottles. In precipitation data `data_rain`, there
are 21 rows and 3 columns. Vraibles are month and the precipitation
amount as “totoal” median
are8

# problem 2

## 2.1 First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day variable.

``` r
data_pol =
  read_csv(file= "data/pols-month.csv")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year","month","day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>%
   mutate(president = ifelse(prez_gop > 0, "gop","dem")) %>%
   select(-day, -prez_gop, - prez_dem)
```

## 2.2 Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
data_snp=read_csv(file = "data/snp.csv")%>%
  separate("date", into = c("day","month","year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE)%>%
   arrange(year, month)%>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[month])%>%
  select(year, month, -day, everything())
```

## 2.3 import and tidy unemployment

``` r
data_unemploy = read_csv(file="data/unemployment.csv")%>%
 pivot_longer(
             Jan:Dec,
             names_to = "month",
             values_to = "employment_value"
) %>% select(year = Year, everything())
```

## 2.4 Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment into the result.

``` r
data_combine= left_join(data_pol, data_snp, by = c("month","year"))
data_tot=left_join(data_combine,data_unemploy, by = c("month", "year"))
```

  - For dataset data\_pol, there are822 rows and 9 columns. \*\* Key
    vairables are time variables including `month` and `year` \*\*
    gov\_gop: the number of republican governors on the associated date
    \*\* sen\_gop: the number of republican senators on the associated
    date \*\* rep\_gop: the number of republican representatives on the
    associated date \*\* gov\_dem: the number of democratic governors on
    the associated date \*\* sen\_dem: the number of democratic senators
    on the associated date \*\* rep\_dem: the number of democratic
    representatives on the associated date

  - For dataset data\_snp, there are 787 rows and 4 columns. \*\* Key
    variables are : \*\* date: the date of the observation \*\* close:
    the closing values of the S\&P stock index on the associated date

  - For dataset data\_unemploy, there are 816 and 3. \*\* Key variables
    are: unemployment\_value: the percentage of unemployment of the
    associated month and year.

For the resulting dataset, there are 1391 rows and 12 columns. the range
of year is from 1947 to 2015 key variables are \*\* gov\_gop: the number
of republican governors on the associated date \*\* sen\_gop: the number
of republican senators on the associated date \*\* rep\_gop: the number
of republican representatives on the associated date \*\* gov\_dem: the
number of democratic governors on the associated date \*\* sen\_dem: the
number of democratic senators on the associated date \*\* rep\_dem: the
number of democratic representatives on the associated date \*\* date:
the date of the observation \*\* close: the closing values of the S\&P
stock index on the associated date \*\* unemployment\_value: the
percentage of unemployment of the associated month an which is a combine
by the above three dataset by month and year.

# Problem 3

## 3.1 read and clean the dataset

``` r
data_baby=read_csv(file="data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "ASIAN AND PACI" = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER", "BLACK NON HISP"= "BLACK NON HISPANIC","WHITE NON HISP" = "WHITE NON HISPANIC"))%>%
  mutate(childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name)) %>%
  distinct()
```

## 3.2 creat a reader friendly table

``` r
data_baby%>% filter(childs_first_name == "olivia",gender == "FEMALE") %>% select(childs_first_name, year_of_birth,ethnicity, rank) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year_of_birth",
              values_from = "rank") %>% knitr::kable()
```

| childs\_first\_name | ethnicity                  | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 |
| :------------------ | :------------------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| olivia              | ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER |    1 |    1 |    1 |    3 |    3 |    4 |
| olivia              | BLACK NON HISPANIC         |    8 |    4 |    8 |    6 |    8 |   10 |
| olivia              | HISPANIC                   |   13 |   16 |   16 |   22 |   22 |   18 |
| olivia              | WHITE NON HISPANIC         |    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    4 |    2 |

``` r
## for male popular name
data_baby%>% filter(gender == "MALE",rank == 1) %>% select(childs_first_name, year_of_birth,ethnicity) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "year_of_birth",
              values_from = "childs_first_name") %>% knitr::kable()
```

| ethnicity                  | 2016   | 2015   | 2014   | 2013   | 2012   | 2011    |
| :------------------------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :------ |
| ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER | ethan  | jayden | jayden | jayden | ryan   | ethan   |
| BLACK NON HISPANIC         | noah   | noah   | ethan  | ethan  | jayden | jayden  |
| HISPANIC                   | liam   | liam   | liam   | jayden | jayden | jayden  |
| WHITE NON HISPANIC         | joseph | david  | joseph | david  | joseph | michael |

## 3.3 Creat a scatterplot

``` r
library(ggridges)
plot_df = filter(data_baby, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC", gender == "MALE", year_of_birth == 2016)
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = rank, y = count)) + geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "The first name of white non-hispanic male children born in 2016",
    x = "The rank in popularity of that name",
    y = "The number of children with a name (count)")
```
